  The Kabbalistic Tree of Life — the esoteric framework the Golden Dawn embedded
  into the Rider-Waite-Smith deck. Ten Sephiroth (emanations of divine creation)
  connected by 22 paths, each carrying one Major Arcana card. Pip cards cluster
  by number into their Sephirah; court cards map to the four Kabbalistic worlds.
  This is the structural skeleton of the deck.
