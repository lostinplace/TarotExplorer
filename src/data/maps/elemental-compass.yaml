description: >
  Four suits radiating outward from a central ring of Major Arcana, organized by
  element and cardinal direction. The simplest and most intuitive map — you see
  at a glance how the four elements relate and contrast. Pip cards radiate from
  center (Ace nearest) to edge (Ten farthest). Court cards anchor the outer rim.
