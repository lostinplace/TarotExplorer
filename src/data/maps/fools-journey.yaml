description: >
  The 22 Major Arcana as a narrative arc of psychological and spiritual
  development — from the Fool's innocent leap into the unknown through worldly
  experience, inward crisis, and cosmic integration. Minor Arcana orbit the
  Major card they most resonate with thematically. Read left to right, top to
  bottom: the story of becoming.

    name: "Act I: The Worldly (0–7)"
    description: >
      The Fool encounters the fundamental forces of the manifest world —
      will (Magician), intuition (Priestess), abundance (Empress), structure
      (Emperor), tradition (Hierophant), love (Lovers), and the drive to
      conquer (Chariot). These are the tools and authorities of external life.

    name: "Act II: The Inward Turn (8–14)"
    description: >
      The Fool turns inward. Strength demands courage over force. The Hermit
      withdraws. The Wheel shows that fate has its own logic. Justice weighs
      the soul. The Hanged Man surrenders control. Death strips away the old.
      Temperance integrates what remains. This is the dark night.

    name: "Act III: The Cosmic (15–21)"
    description: >
      The Fool confronts the transpersonal. The Devil shows bondage to
      illusion. The Tower destroys false structures. The Star restores hope.
      The Moon walks through fear. The Sun illuminates truth. Judgement calls
      the self to account. The World completes the cycle — wholeness,
      integration, the dance.
