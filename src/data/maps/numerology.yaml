description: >
  Cards organized by number, revealing the patterns that repeat across suits and
  arcana. Each row is a number (Ace through Ten); each column is a suit. Major
  Arcana appear in a separate column, grouped by their numerological reduction.
  Read across to see how the same energy manifests in different elements. Read
  down to see how each element develops from seed (Ace) to completion (Ten).
