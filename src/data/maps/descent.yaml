id: descent
name: "The Descent and Return"
description: >
  A vertical map shaped like a well — down one side, through the depths,
  back up the other. Cards are placed in narrative order along a U-shaped
  path. The left column descends; the bottom row holds the depths; the
  right column ascends. Depth on the map IS depth in the story.
