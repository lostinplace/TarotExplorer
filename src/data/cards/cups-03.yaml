  keywords:
    - Celebration
    - Friendship
    - Community
    - Joy
    - Abundance
  meaning: >
    Three women raise their cups in a toast, surrounded by the fruits of the
    harvest. This is joy shared — not private satisfaction but communal
    celebration. Friendships, creative collaborations, reunions, and any
    moment where happiness multiplies by being given away.

  keywords:
    - Overindulgence
    - Exclusion
    - Gossip
    - Isolation from community
    - Superficial socializing
  meaning: >
    The celebration turns hollow or excessive. Drinking to forget rather than
    to celebrate. Social connection that's performative rather than genuine,
    or feeling excluded from a group. Can indicate the aftermath of too much
    revelry — the hangover, literal or emotional.
imagery:
  - element: Three women dancing in a circle, raising cups
    significance: >
      The triple goddess or the three Graces (Aglaia, Euphrosyne, Thalia) —
      beauty, mirth, and abundance dancing together. The circular formation
      suggests equality; no one leads. Joy here is communal and reciprocal.
    tradition: Greek — the Three Graces / Triple Goddess
  - element: Harvest fruits and vegetables at their feet
    significance: >
      Pumpkins, grapes, and gourds — the bounty of autumn. Celebration that
      is earned through shared labor. The harvest is the occasion; the
      connection between the women is the real abundance.
    tradition: Agricultural / seasonal cycle
  - element: Garlands in their hair and flowing robes
    significance: >
      Festive adornment — these women have dressed for the occasion. The
      different colored robes (red, white, gold/orange) suggest distinct
      personalities united in shared feeling.
    tradition: Classical festival imagery
  - element: Open, bright landscape
    significance: >
      Unlike many Cups cards with water or clouds, this scene is sunny and
      grounded. Joy here is not dreamy or introverted — it's embodied,
      physical, happening in the daylight world.
    tradition: Pastoral
correspondences:
  element: Water
  planet: Mercury

  tree_of_life: "Binah (3 — Understanding)"
  numerology: >
    3 — synthesis, creativity, the first fruit of combination. Where 2 is
    the pair, 3 is what they create together. The number of expression,
    growth, and the social unit beyond the couple.
  colors:
    - Red (vitality, passion)
    - White (purity, joy)
    - Gold (abundance, harvest)

      beyond the dyad into friendship, family, and collective joy.
  - card: pentacles-03
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Three of Pentacles is collaboration in work; the Three of Cups
      is collaboration in celebration. Both honor what's created when
      people bring different gifts to a shared purpose.

    relationship: polarity
    description: >
      The Five grieves alone; the Three celebrates together. They are
      mirror images of how we relate to others in emotional extremes.
  - card: major-21
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The World also depicts a figure dancing in celebration — the
      completion of a great cycle. The Three of Cups is a smaller,
      more human version of that cosmic joy.
themes:
  - Joy as a communal act — happiness amplified through sharing
  - Friendship as a form of love distinct from romance
  - The harvest — celebration that follows effort and collaboration
  - The feminine creative — women's circles, sisterhood, collective power
questions:
  - Who are the people you celebrate with — your inner circle of joy?
  - When did you last experience genuine communal happiness, not just socializing?
  - What have you harvested recently that deserves celebration?
  - How do you distinguish between real connection and performative togetherness?

      Pollack connects the Three to the Graces and emphasizes the
      emotional abundance that comes from genuine friendship rather
      than romantic love.

  - title: The Pictorial Key to the Tarot
    author: Arthur Edward Waite
    relevance: >
      Waite describes "the conclusion of any matter in plenty, perfection,
      and merriment." Note the emphasis on conclusion — this is joy at
      the end of something, not the beginning.
