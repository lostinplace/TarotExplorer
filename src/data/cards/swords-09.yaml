  meaning: >
    A figure sits up in bed, face in hands, nine swords mounted horizontally
    on the wall behind. This is 3 AM anxiety — the thoughts that attack in
    the dark when defenses are down. The mind torturing itself with worst-case
    scenarios, guilt, shame, or dread. The swords aren't falling; they're
    just there, and that's enough.

  keywords:
    - Recovery from anxiety
    - Releasing worry
    - Light at the end
    - Sharing your burden
    - Inner calm returning
  meaning: >
    Reversed, the nightmare begins to break. You wake up and realize the fears
    were exaggerated — or you finally share the burden that's been eating you
    alive. Can also indicate deep-seated anxiety that hasn't surfaced yet, the
    depression beneath the panic.
imagery:
  - element: Figure sitting up in bed, face in hands
    significance: >
      The universal posture of anguish — woken from sleep (or unable to sleep)
      by the mind's own cruelty. The bedroom, normally a place of rest and
      safety, has become a torture chamber. The darkness is internal.
    tradition: RWS psychological realism
  - element: Nine swords mounted horizontally on the black wall
    significance: >
      The swords are arranged in a grid — ordered, systematic, relentless.
      These aren't chaotic threats but organized anxieties, each one a
      distinct worry or regret catalogued by the mind. Nine is one short of
      completion — the dread of what's coming next.
    tradition: Numerological — Yesod (foundation) destabilized
  - element: Quilt decorated with roses and astrological symbols
    significance: >
      Even in anguish, beauty and meaning persist — the quilt suggests that
      the sufferer's life contains richness they can't see right now. The
      zodiac signs hint at fate and cosmic order beneath personal chaos.
    tradition: RWS detail — comfort objects in dark scenes
  - element: Carved bed panel showing one figure defeating another
    significance: >
      A scene of combat or domination carved into the bed itself — the mind
      at war with itself is embedded in the very structure of rest. You bring
      the battle to bed with you.
    tradition: RWS symbolic furniture

  numerology: >
    9 — culmination, the final single digit. In Swords, nine is the mind's
    anguish reaching its peak before the Ten's total collapse. Everything
    you've worried about crystallizes into this one sleepless night.
  colors:
    - Black (the wall — darkness, the void of 3 AM)
    - Yellow (the quilt — life and warmth still present but ignored)

    description: >
      The Eight's mental prison becomes the Nine's mental torture. Trapped
      in your thoughts during the day (Eight), tormented by them at night
      (Nine). The progression from restriction to anguish.
  - card: swords-03
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Three is acute heartbreak — sharp, specific pain. The Nine is
      chronic anxiety — diffuse, nocturnal, self-generated. Different
      flavors of mental suffering.
  - card: major-18
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Moon card rules the night, fear, and the unconscious. The Nine
      of Swords is the lived experience of the Moon's terrain — lost in
      darkness with your own fears as companions.
themes:
  - "The mind as its own torturer"
  - "Anxiety as distorted perception — real feelings about unreal threats"
  - "The loneliness of 3 AM — suffering that can't be shared"
  - "The gap between what you fear and what is actually happening"
questions:
  - What are you lying awake worrying about, and how much of it is real?
  - What would you tell a friend who was carrying this same anxiety?
  - When has your worst fear actually come true — and when hasn't it?
  - What would it take to share what's keeping you up at night?
references:
  - title: Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom
    author: Rachel Pollack
    relevance: >
      Pollack emphasizes that the Nine shows suffering that is primarily
      mental — the swords don't touch the figure. The anguish is
      self-generated, which is both the problem and the potential solution.

  - title: The Pictorial Key to the Tarot
    author: Arthur Edward Waite
    relevance: >
      Waite lists "death, failure, miscarriage, delay, deception" — but
      Smith painted anxiety, not events. The card is about the fear of
      these things, not their occurrence.
