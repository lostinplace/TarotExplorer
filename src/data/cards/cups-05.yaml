    - Loss

    - Regret
    - Disappointment
    - Focusing on the negative
  meaning: >
    A cloaked figure stares down at three spilled cups while two remain standing
    behind them, unseen. This is grief that narrows your vision — real loss,
    but also the tendency to fixate on what's gone while ignoring what remains.
    The card honors the pain while gently pointing out the bridge home.

  keywords:
    - Acceptance
    - Moving on
    - Finding what remains
    - Forgiveness
    - Recovery
  meaning: >
    The figure turns around and sees the two standing cups. Recovery begins not
    when the pain ends, but when you stop staring exclusively at what was lost.
    Reversed can mark the moment of acceptance — choosing to cross the bridge
    rather than stand mourning on this side of the river.
imagery:
  - element: Cloaked figure in black, head bowed toward three spilled cups
    significance: >
      Grief embodied — the black cloak, the bowed posture, the inability to
      look away from the loss. The figure's back is turned to the viewer and
      to the remaining cups, illustrating how mourning can become a kind of
      tunnel vision. We see what they cannot.
    tradition: Memento mori / grief iconography
  - element: Three cups spilled, red liquid flowing out
    significance: >
      Three losses — love, connection, or joy poured out and irrecoverable.
      The red liquid suggests blood or wine, both loaded with sacrificial
      meaning. What's spilled cannot be gathered back up.
    tradition: Sacramental — spilled wine as sacrifice
  - element: Two cups still standing behind the figure
    significance: >
      The card's hidden mercy. Not everything is lost — but the figure can't
      see them yet. The composition forces the reader to notice what the
      mourner cannot, making this a card about perspective as much as loss.
    tradition: Compositional / narrative symbolism
  - element: Bridge leading to a castle or house across a river
    significance: >
      The way home still exists. The bridge represents the path back to
      stability, community, and shelter — but it requires the figure to
      turn around and walk. Recovery is available but not automatic.
    tradition: Landscape symbolism — the bridge as transition
  - element: River flowing between the figure and the distant home
    significance: >
      Emotional current that must be crossed. The river separates the place
      of grief from the place of belonging. Water — the element of Cups —
      is both the medium of the pain and the thing that must be navigated
      to reach the other side.
    tradition: Elemental / mythological (Styx, Jordan)

  numerology: >
    5 — disruption, conflict, instability. The midpoint crisis of each suit.
    Fives break the stability of the Fours. In Cups, the disruption is
    emotional — loss that shatters the comfortable stagnation of the Four.
  colors:
    - Black (mourning, grief)
    - Red (spilled emotion, passion lost)
    - Grey (desolation, overcast feeling)
connections:

    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      The Four's apathy becomes the Five's grief. What was merely unsatisfying
      is now actively painful. Discontent gives way to genuine loss.
  - card: cups-06
    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      After the Five's grief, the Six offers nostalgia — looking back at
      happier times. The sequence from Five to Six is the movement from
      mourning to memory, from raw loss to bittersweet remembrance.
  - card: cups-02
    relationship: shadow
    description: >
      The Five is the shadow of the Two — the grief that becomes possible
      only because a real bond existed. You can only lose what you once had.
  - card: swords-03
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Three of Swords is heartbreak as a piercing insight; the Five of
      Cups is heartbreak as lingering grief. One is the wound; the other
      is the long ache afterward.
themes:
  - Grief as tunnel vision — real pain, distorted perspective
  - What remains — the mercy hidden inside loss
  - The bridge home — recovery as a choice, not a feeling
  - Mourning as a stage, not a destination
questions:
  - What are you grieving that you haven't fully acknowledged?
  - What still stands behind you that you've been unable to see?
  - Is your mourning honoring the loss, or has it become its own trap?
  - What bridge is waiting for you when you're ready to turn around?

      Pollack emphasizes the compositional brilliance — Pamela Colman Smith
      forces the reader to see what the figure cannot. She reads the card
      as fundamentally about perspective.

      Waite describes "a dark, cloaked figure looking at three prone cups;
      two others stand upright behind him." His keywords include "loss"
      but also "inheritance" — something remains.
