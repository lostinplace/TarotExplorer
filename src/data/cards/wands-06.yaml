  keywords:
    - Victory
    - Recognition
    - Public acclaim
    - Triumph
    - Confidence
  meaning: >
    A rider crowned with laurels leads a procession, wand held high with a
    wreath of victory. This is success made public — not just achieving
    something, but being seen and acknowledged for it. The crowd validates
    the effort. Enjoy it, but remember: the parade ends.
reversed:
  keywords:
    - Fall from grace
    - Hollow victory
    - Ego inflation
    - Lack of recognition
    - Seeking external validation
  meaning: >
    The applause fades or never comes. Either your victory is hollow — won
    for the wrong reasons or at someone else's expense — or genuine
    achievement goes unrecognized. Can also indicate becoming addicted to
    acclaim, chasing applause rather than doing meaningful work.
imagery:
  - element: Mounted figure wearing a laurel wreath
    significance: >
      The rider is elevated above the crowd — literally on horseback, crowned
      with victory. The laurel wreath is the classical symbol of triumph,
      connecting this card to Roman and Greek victory traditions. Being
      mounted suggests momentum and continued forward motion.
    tradition: Greco-Roman — laurel as symbol of Apollo and victory
  - element: Wreath on the wand
    significance: >
      A second wreath adorns the wand itself — the tool of creative will is
      also crowned. This isn't just personal success; it's the triumph of the
      vision, the project, the creative endeavor. The work is honored, not
      just the worker.
    tradition: RWS symbolic — decorated wand as honored enterprise
  - element: Crowd of followers with wands
    significance: >
      The procession implies that victory is social — it requires witnesses.
      The followers carry their own wands, suggesting they're fellow
      competitors or supporters, not subjects. Recognition from peers
      carries weight.
    tradition: RWS — crowd as social validation
  - element: Red cloak on the rider
    significance: >
      Red for passion, courage, and Mars energy. The rider has earned this
      through action and daring, not through patience or cunning. This is
      Fire's kind of victory — bold, visible, unapologetic.
