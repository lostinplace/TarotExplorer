  meaning: >
    The Wheel turns — what was down comes up, what was up comes down. This is
    the great cycle of fortune, the reminder that change is the only constant.
    You are not in control of the Wheel, but you can choose how you ride it.
    This card marks a pivot point where fate intervenes and the landscape
    shifts.

  keywords:
    - Bad luck
    - Resistance to change
    - Breaking cycles
    - Setbacks
    - Karmic repetition
  meaning: >
    Reversed, the Wheel suggests fighting against inevitable change, a downturn
    in fortune, or the need to break free from a repeating pattern. You may be
    stuck in a cycle — same mistakes, same dynamics, different faces. The
    question is whether you're learning from the rotation or just enduring it.
imagery:
  - element: Central wheel with TARO/ROTA letters and Hebrew YHVH
    significance: >
      The outer ring bears four letters — T, A, R, O — which also spell ROTA
      (Latin for wheel), TORA, and TAROT. Interspersed are the Hebrew letters
      Yod, Heh, Vav, Heh — the Tetragrammaton, the unpronounceable name of God.
      The wheel of fate and the divine name occupy the same circle: fortune and
      providence are intertwined.
    tradition: Hermetic / Kabbalistic / Latin
  - element: Alchemical symbols on the inner wheel
    significance: >
      Mercury, sulfur, water, and salt — the four alchemical principles. The
      inner workings of the Wheel are alchemical transformation: base
      experience transmuted through the cycle of change. What looks like random
      fortune has an inner logic.
    tradition: Alchemical
  - element: Sphinx atop the wheel holding a sword
    significance: >
      The sphinx represents the fixed point of wisdom that does not turn with
      the wheel. It sits at the apex, bearing a sword of discernment. The
      riddle of the sphinx: understanding the nature of change is the key to
      surviving it. Only awareness sits still while fortune revolves.
    tradition: Egyptian / Greek (Oedipus myth)
  - element: Serpent descending on the left
    significance: >
      Typhon/Set — the descending principle, entropy, the downward arc of
      fortune. The serpent slides down the Wheel's left side, representing the
      fall from grace, the inevitable decline that follows every peak.
    tradition: Egyptian (Set/Typhon) / Biblical (the Fall)
  - element: Anubis rising on the right
    significance: >
      The jackal-headed figure ascending — Anubis/Hermanubis, guide of souls,
      the principle of regeneration. What goes down must come back up. The
      psychopomp who escorts you through the underworld and back.
    tradition: Egyptian (Anubis) / Hermetic
  - element: Four winged creatures in the corners
    significance: >
      The cherubim of Ezekiel's vision — bull, lion, eagle, and human/angel —
      representing the four fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius) and
      the four elements. Each reads a book: the fixed signs provide the stable
      framework within which the Wheel turns. They appear again in The World.
    tradition: "Biblical (Ezekiel 1:10, Revelation 4:7) / Astrological"

  numerology: >
    10 — completion and return. The Pythagorean Tetractys (1+2+3+4=10),
    containing all numbers within itself. Ten is one and zero: the return
    to unity at a higher level. The Wheel marks the midpoint of the Major
    Arcana — the turn from outer to inner journey.
  colors:
    - Blue (celestial background, the sky of fate)
    - Orange (the Wheel, alchemical fire, transformation)
    - Yellow (the sphinx, wisdom, solar awareness)

    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The World and the Wheel share the four cherubim in the corners — the
      same cosmic framework. The Wheel shows fate in motion; The World shows
      the dance within fate's circle. Spinning versus dancing.
  - card: major-09
    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      The Hermit's inner preparation meets the Wheel's external change.
      After solitary reflection, fate intervenes — ready or not. The
      transition from inner work to the world's response.
  - card: major-13
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      Death and the Wheel both speak to inevitable transformation. The Wheel
      is the abstract principle; Death is the lived experience. One turns,
      the other arrives.
  - card: major-00
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Fool and the Wheel both involve stepping into what you can't
      control. The Fool chooses to leap; the Wheel turns regardless.
      Innocence and fate — both are beyond your management.
themes:
  - "Impermanence — the Buddhist and Stoic insight that nothing lasts"
  - "Kairos versus chronos — the moment of turning versus the flow of linear time"
  - "Fortune as teacher — what you learn from loss that success can't teach"
  - "The pattern beneath the chaos — cycles, seasons, and the hidden order in change"
questions:
  - "What cycle are you currently in — ascending, descending, or at a turning point?"
  - "What pattern keeps repeating in your life, and what would it take to break it?"
  - "How do you relate to changes you didn't choose — do you ride them or resist them?"
  - "What would you do differently if you truly accepted that this, too, shall pass?"

    author: Arthur Edward Waite
    relevance: >
      Waite's description emphasizes the wheel as the "perpetual motion of a
      fluidic universe." His occult readers would have recognized the ROTA/TARO
      cipher immediately.
