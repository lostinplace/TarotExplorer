upright:
  keywords:
    - Partnership
    - Mutual attraction
    - Unity
    - Connection
    - Reciprocity
  meaning: >
    Two figures face each other and exchange cups in a voluntary, equal bond.
    This is love as mutual recognition — not infatuation, not possession, but
    two people choosing each other. Partnerships, engagements, deep friendships,
    or any relationship built on genuine reciprocity.
reversed:
  keywords:
    - Imbalance in relationship
    - Broken partnership
    - Miscommunication
    - Codependency
    - Separation
  meaning: >
    The exchange becomes unequal. One gives more than they receive, or the
    connection has curdled into dependency or resentment. Can indicate a
    breakup, a falling out, or a partnership where the original spark of
    recognition has been lost. Sometimes simply: bad timing.
imagery:
  - element: A man and woman facing each other, each holding a cup
    significance: >
      The voluntary exchange — neither compelled, both offering. The equality
      of their posture is the point: this is not conquest or surrender but
      mutual choice. The two figures mirror each other, suggesting recognition
      of self in the other.
    tradition: Alchemical — the coniunctio, union of opposites
  - element: Caduceus of Hermes rising between them — two snakes around a winged staff
    significance: >
      The caduceus represents healing, commerce, and communication between
      realms. The two serpents are opposing forces reconciled. In the context
      of partnership, it suggests that healthy union requires the integration
      of differences, not their elimination.
    tradition: Hermetic / Greek — the staff of Hermes/Mercury
  - element: Lion's head atop the caduceus
    significance: >
      The lion symbolizes passion, courage, and raw desire — but here it
      crowns a symbol of balance. Passion channeled through communication
      and mutual respect. Some read this as the alchemical Red Lion,
      representing the solar/masculine principle tamed by relationship.
    tradition: Alchemical / Hermetic
  - element: Garlands and pastoral background
    significance: >
      The setting is gentle, domestic, peaceful. No drama, no storm — just
      two people in a garden. The wreaths suggest celebration or ritual,
      evoking the handfasting or betrothal ceremony.
    tradition: Pastoral / ceremonial
correspondences:
  element: Water
  planet: Venus

    it takes two to create a bond, a polarity, a dialogue. The number of
    choice and of mirroring.
  colors:
    - Blue (emotion, trust)
    - Red (passion, desire)
    - Gold (the caduceus — sacred union)

    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      The Ace is the seed of emotional potential; the Two is its first
      directed expression — love finds an object, feeling finds a partner.
  - card: major-06
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Lovers shares the theme of sacred union and choice, but at a
      cosmic scale. The Two of Cups is the human, everyday version —
      no angel required, just two people choosing each other.
  - card: swords-02
    relationship: polarity
    description: >
      The Two of Swords is the mind divided, refusing to choose. The Two
      of Cups is the heart united, choosing freely. Both are about
      duality — one resolves it, the other is stuck in it.
  - card: cups-05
    relationship: shadow
    description: >
      The Five of Cups is what happens when the bond of the Two breaks.
      The grief of the Five only makes sense in light of the love that
      the Two established.
themes:
  - Sacred reciprocity — love as equal exchange, not transaction
  - Recognition — seeing yourself reflected in another person
  - The alchemy of relationship — two becoming something greater than the sum
  - Chosen bonds — partnership as conscious act, not fate or accident
questions:
  - In your closest relationships, is the giving and receiving truly equal?
  - Who do you recognize as a genuine mirror — someone who reflects your truest self?
  - What is the difference between partnership and dependency in your life?
  - When has choosing someone been the bravest thing you've done?

      Pollack's reading emphasizes the alchemical dimension — the caduceus
      as coniunctio. She distinguishes the Two from The Lovers by scale
      and context.

      Waite describes "love, passion, friendship, affinity, union" — note
      how broadly he frames the card beyond romance.
