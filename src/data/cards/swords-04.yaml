    - Contemplation
    - Solitude
  meaning: >
    A knight lies in effigy upon a tomb, hands in prayer, three swords on the
    wall above and one beneath him. After the Three's heartbreak comes enforced
    rest — not death, but the stillness required for recovery. This is the
    mind's need to withdraw, process, and heal before re-engaging.
reversed:
  keywords:
    - Restlessness
    - Burnout
    - Forced activity
    - Refusing to rest
    - Stagnation
  meaning: >
    Reversed, the rest is either refused or has gone on too long. You push
    through exhaustion when you should retreat, or you've retreated so far
    that isolation has become avoidance. The mind that won't stop spinning,
    or the mind that has checked out entirely.
imagery:
  - element: Recumbent knight on a stone tomb
    significance: >
      Not dead — resting. The figure is a knight's effigy, suggesting a
      warrior who has temporarily laid down arms. The stone tomb evokes a
      church or sacred space; this is sanctuary, not burial. Healing happens
      in stillness.
    tradition: Medieval tomb effigies / Church sanctuary tradition
  - element: Three swords mounted on the wall
    significance: >
      The three swords from the previous card are hung up — the pain is
      acknowledged but set aside. They remain present (you can't un-know
      what hurt you) but are no longer actively piercing.
    tradition: Sequential narrative across the RWS pip cards
  - element: One sword beneath the figure
    significance: >
      A single sword lies beneath the knight, suggesting a truth held close
      even in rest — awareness maintained even in withdrawal. You rest but
      you don't forget.
    tradition: Hermetic — the reserved blade
  - element: Stained glass window showing a figure offering blessing
    significance: >
      A devotional scene suggesting grace, healing, or spiritual comfort
      received during retreat. The window lets colored light in — even in
      withdrawal, something luminous enters.
    tradition: Christian sanctuary / devotional art
correspondences:

  tree_of_life: Chesed (Mercy) — stability, benevolence, rest after severity
  numerology: >
    4 — stability, structure, the square. In Swords, four creates the
    container that holds the mind still — the room, the tomb, the enforced
    pause. Chesed's mercy after Binah's sorrow.
  colors:
    - Grey (stone — endurance, withdrawal)
    - Gold (the stained glass — grace entering)
    - Yellow (the figure's garment — the spirit resting within matter)

    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      The Three pierces the heart; the Four retreats to heal. Pain demands
      rest. This is the necessary aftermath — you cannot move through grief
      without pause.
  - card: major-04
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Emperor structures and stabilizes; the Four of Swords stabilizes
      through withdrawal. Both are fours — creating order — but the Emperor
      acts outward while the Four of Swords acts inward.
  - card: major-12
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Hanged Man also finds wisdom in suspension and stillness. Both cards
      suggest that sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is stop.
themes:
  - "Strategic withdrawal — retreat as wisdom, not weakness"
  - "The mind's need for sanctuary"
  - "Recovery as an active process disguised as passivity"
  - "The pause between crisis and resolution"
questions:
  - What would happen if you gave yourself permission to stop?
  - Are you resting or hiding?
  - What healing can only happen in solitude?
  - When did you last truly let your mind be still?

      Pollack distinguishes between the Four as genuine recuperation versus
      escapist withdrawal — a critical nuance for readings.

    relevance: >
      Waite emphasizes "vigilance, retreat, solitude" — the idea that rest
      here is watchful, not unconscious.
