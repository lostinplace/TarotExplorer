  meaning: >
    Three generations gather at the gates of a grand estate — an elder
    patriarch with dogs at his feet, a couple in the middle ground, a child
    reaching toward one of the dogs. Ten pentacles are arranged in the
    pattern of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. This is wealth that endures
    beyond a single lifetime: legacy, tradition, the material foundation
    that allows the next generation to build higher.

  keywords:
    - Family disputes
    - Financial failure
    - Broken legacy
    - Inherited burdens
    - Instability
  meaning: >
    Reversed, the legacy fractures. Family disputes over inheritance,
    wealth that divides rather than unites, or discovering that what was
    passed down is debt rather than abundance. The family estate becomes
    a family curse. Sometimes you need to break from tradition to build
    something genuinely yours.
imagery:
  - element: Ten pentacles arranged in the Tree of Life pattern
    significance: >
      The Kabbalistic Tree of Life — ten Sephiroth mapped onto ten coins.
      This is the most overtly esoteric arrangement in the minor arcana.
      Material wealth here mirrors divine structure: abundance organized
      by cosmic principle. The implication is that lasting wealth
      participates in a sacred order.
    tradition: Kabbalistic — the ten Sephiroth
  - element: Elderly patriarch seated with two dogs
    significance: >
      The elder is the source of the legacy — seated, established, at rest.
      The dogs represent loyalty and domestic comfort. He has built
      something, and now he watches it continue. His richly embroidered
      robe suggests wealth accumulated over a lifetime.
    tradition: Patriarchal / dynastic symbolism
  - element: Couple in the middle ground under an archway
    significance: >
      The next generation — inheritors of the elder's work, parents of the
      child. They stand under the arch of the estate, benefiting from its
      structure. The arch frames them, suggesting both protection and
      containment within tradition.
    tradition: Family / architectural symbolism
  - element: Child reaching toward a dog
    significance: >
      The youngest generation, innocent of the wealth's complexity. The
      child's gesture toward the dog is simple, joyful — she doesn't
      understand inheritance yet. She will grow up inside this structure,
      shaped by it for better or worse.
    tradition: Generational symbolism
  - element: Grand estate with stone archway and walls
    significance: >
      The physical structure of lasting wealth — not coins but stone,
      architecture, property. The estate is the pentacles made permanent.
      It shelters but also defines; family wealth creates both freedom
      and obligation.
    tradition: Feudal / property symbolism

  tree_of_life: "Malkuth (Kingdom) — the fullest manifestation of Earth"
  numerology: >
    10 — completion, the end of a cycle, fullness that contains a new
    beginning. Ten contains all single digits — it is totality. In
    Pentacles, ten is wealth so complete it becomes legacy.
  colors:
    - Gold (wealth, the pentacles, material fulfillment)
    - Rich reds and blues (embroidered robes — dynastic richness)
    - Grey stone (permanence, architecture, lasting structure)

    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      The Ace is the seed; the Ten is the forest. The single opportunity
      offered by the divine hand has been cultivated across generations
      into an estate, a family, a legacy. The full arc of material
      manifestation.
  - card: pentacles-04
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Four clutches wealth alone; the Ten shares it across generations.
      Both address material security, but the Four's fearful grip becomes
      the Ten's open architecture. Hoarding versus building.
  - card: major-21
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The World and the Ten of Pentacles both represent completion — the
      World in all dimensions, the Ten specifically in the material realm.
      The Tree of Life pattern in the Ten echoes the World's wholeness.
  - card: cups-10
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      Both Tens depict family happiness and fulfillment. The Ten of Cups
      is emotional wholeness (the rainbow); the Ten of Pentacles is
      material wholeness (the estate). Together they represent the
      complete human inheritance.
themes:
  - "Legacy — building something that outlasts you"
  - "The weight of inheritance — wealth as both gift and obligation"
  - "Sacred structure — material abundance organized by spiritual principle"
  - "Generational wealth — what gets passed down and what gets left behind"
questions:
  - "What are you building that will outlast your lifetime?"
  - "What have you inherited — materially and psychologically — and what do you owe it?"
  - "Does your current path create a foundation for those who come after you?"
