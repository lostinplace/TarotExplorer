    - Nostalgia
    - Innocence
    - Childhood
    - Generosity
    - Simple pleasures
  meaning: >
    A child offers a cup filled with flowers to a smaller child in what
    appears to be a courtyard of an old estate. This is the warmth of memory
    — kindness given freely, the sweetness of the past, the innocence you
    carry forward from childhood. Reunions, gifts with no strings, and the
    comfort of familiar places.

  keywords:
    - Living in the past
    - Naivety
    - Stagnation through nostalgia
    - Childhood wounds
    - Rose-colored glasses
  meaning: >
    Nostalgia becomes a trap. You're idealizing the past at the expense of
    the present, or childhood patterns are running your adult life without
    your awareness. Can indicate unresolved childhood issues surfacing, or
    the refusal to grow up. The sweetness has turned saccharine.
imagery:
  - element: Older child offering a cup of white flowers to a younger child
    significance: >
      Generosity without calculation — a child's gift, given simply because
      giving feels good. The flowers suggest innocence and beauty offered
      freely. The size difference implies mentorship or protection, the
      older self caring for the younger.
    tradition: Pastoral / innocence symbolism
  - element: Six cups arranged in the courtyard, each containing flowers
    significance: >
      Six fulfilled emotional experiences, each blooming. The number six
      represents harmony and balance — after the disruption of the Five,
      equilibrium returns through the healing power of memory and kindness.
    tradition: Numerological — six as restoration
  - element: Old stone buildings and courtyard setting
    significance: >
      An ancestral home, the place you grew up, the architecture of memory.
      The buildings are solid and old — the past is stable and enduring,
      even as you've moved on from it. There's a guard or older figure
      walking away in the background.
    tradition: Architectural — home as emotional anchor
  - element: A guard or adult figure retreating in the background
    significance: >
      The adult world recedes, leaving the children to their exchange.
      Responsibility, vigilance, and the harder aspects of maturity step
      back to let innocence have its moment. Some read this as the querent
      themselves, walking away from present concerns into memory.
    tradition: Compositional / narrative symbolism

  numerology: >
    6 — harmony, beauty, balance restored. After the disruption of 5, the
    6 finds equilibrium through integration. In Cups, this harmony comes
    through revisiting what was good — letting the past nourish the present.
  colors:
    - Yellow (warmth, sunlight, childhood brightness)
    - White (innocence, purity of intention)
    - Green (growth, the garden of memory)

    description: >
      After the Five's grief, the Six finds comfort in remembering what was
      good. The mourner turns to memory for healing — nostalgia as balm.
  - card: cups-07
    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      The Six's sweet memories can tip into the Seven's fantasies. Nostalgia
      unchecked becomes illusion — remembering what never was.
  - card: major-19
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Sun card also features children and innocence in bright light.
      The Six of Cups is a smaller, more personal echo — not cosmic joy
      but the quiet warmth of a remembered afternoon.
  - card: pentacles-06
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      Both Sixes involve giving and receiving. The Six of Pentacles gives
      material aid; the Six of Cups gives emotional warmth. Both ask:
      what does it mean to give freely?
themes:
  - Nostalgia as medicine — the healing power of happy memories
  - Innocence — the child's way of seeing as a gift, not a weakness
  - The past in the present — how early experiences shape who we are now
  - Simple generosity — giving without expectation or calculation
questions:
  - What childhood memory still nourishes you when you return to it?
  - Are you visiting the past for comfort or hiding there to avoid the present?
  - What would your childhood self think of the person you've become?
  - Who in your life offers you kindness with no strings attached?

    author: Rachel Pollack
    relevance: >
      Pollack reads the Six as the card of childhood and the past, but
      warns against reading it as purely sentimental — the past can heal
      or imprison depending on how you hold it.

      Waite's description includes "a card of the past and of memories"
      and "things that have vanished." Note the melancholy under the
      sweetness in his reading.
