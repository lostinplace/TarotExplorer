  keywords:
    - Perseverance
    - Defensiveness
    - Standing your ground
    - Challenge
    - Courage under pressure
  meaning: >
    A figure stands on high ground, wand raised, fending off six wands thrust
    up from below. Success has attracted challengers — now you must defend your
    position. This isn't about starting a fight; it's about refusing to yield
    what you've earned. The advantage of high ground matters.
reversed:
  keywords:
    - Giving up
    - Overwhelm
    - Caving to pressure
    - Exhaustion
    - Losing ground
  meaning: >
    The defense crumbles. You're exhausted from holding your position, the
    challengers are too many, or you realize what you're defending isn't worth
    the fight. Can also indicate stubbornness — defending a position out of
    pride when strategic retreat would serve better.
imagery:
  - element: Figure on elevated ground with one wand against six
    significance: >
      The high ground is both literal and metaphorical — an advantageous
      position earned through prior effort. One against many, but the
      elevation equalizes the odds. This is the cost of the Six's victory:
      being at the top makes you a target.
    tradition: RWS — spatial positioning as power dynamic
  - element: Mismatched shoes (or one bare foot)
    significance: >
      A famous detail — the figure appears to be wearing mismatched footwear,
      suggesting he was caught off-guard. The defense is improvised, not
      planned. You don't always get to prepare for challenges; sometimes
      you fight in whatever you're wearing.
    tradition: RWS scenic detail — Pamela Colman Smith's visual storytelling
  - element: Six wands attacking from below
    significance: >
      The challengers are faceless — only their wands are visible. This
      makes the opposition feel impersonal and relentless. It could be
      competition, criticism, or simply the gravitational pull of others
      wanting what you have.
    tradition: RWS — faceless opposition as systemic challenge
  - element: Green hillside
    significance: >
      The ground beneath is fertile and alive — what's being defended has
      value and vitality. This isn't a barren hill; it's worth holding.
    tradition: Elemental — green as living value
