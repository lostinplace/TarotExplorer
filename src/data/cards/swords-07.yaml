    - Cunning
  meaning: >
    A figure tiptoes away from a military camp carrying five swords, leaving two
    behind. The classic image of the thief — but also the strategist. This card
    asks: are you being clever or dishonest? Sometimes you need to use cunning
    rather than confrontation. Sometimes you're just stealing.

  keywords:
    - Getting caught
    - Coming clean
    - Self-deception
    - Imposter syndrome
    - Confession
  meaning: >
    Reversed, the scheme unravels. You're caught, or the weight of deception
    becomes unbearable and you confess. Can also point inward — the lies you
    tell yourself, the ways you steal from your own integrity. Sometimes
    reversed means the courage to finally be honest.
imagery:
  - element: Figure carrying five swords while looking back
    significance: >
      The backward glance is key — he's checking if he's been seen. This is
      not confident action but furtive movement. He carries more than he can
      manage (five swords) suggesting overreach. Greed or cleverness — the
      card doesn't decide for you.
    tradition: RWS moral ambiguity in figure posture
  - element: Two swords left behind in the ground
    significance: >
      He couldn't take everything — the plan has gaps. Whether this represents
      incomplete deception (evidence left behind) or calculated sacrifice
      (taking what matters, leaving the rest), something remains.
    tradition: Narrative symbolism
  - element: Military camp with colorful tents
    significance: >
      The tents suggest an organized group — an army, a community, a system.
      The thief acts alone against the collective. This could be rebellion
      against unjust authority or betrayal of those who trusted you.
    tradition: Military / community symbolism
  - element: The figure's light, almost dancing step
    significance: >
      Smith draws him almost jauntily — there's pleasure in the cleverness.
      This is not a desperate thief but someone enjoying the game. The
      lightness suggests either skill or dangerous overconfidence.

  numerology: >
    7 — inner work, assessment, the number that questions. In Swords, seven
    turns the mind's sharpness toward strategy and self-interest. Are you
    being strategic or just sneaky?
  colors:
    - Yellow (the sky — exposed, bright, nowhere to hide)
    - Red (tent accents — the passion or danger he's leaving behind)

    description: >
      The Magician channels power transparently; the Seven of Swords uses
      the same cleverness covertly. Same mental agility, different ethics.
      The shadow side of "as above, so below" is "what they don't know
      won't hurt them."
  - card: swords-05
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Five wins through aggression; the Seven wins through stealth.
      Both involve taking what belongs to others, but the Seven is more
      calculated and less confrontational.
  - card: major-07
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Chariot moves forward with controlled will; the Seven of Swords
      moves sideways with cunning. Both sevens involve directed movement
      and strategy.
themes:
  - "The ethics of strategy — when does cleverness become dishonesty?"
  - "Acting alone against the group — rebellion or betrayal?"
  - "Self-deception — the lies we tell ourselves about our own motives"
  - "Incomplete plans — what you leave behind catches up"
questions:
  - What are you getting away with, and what is it costing you?
  - Is your strategy serving a genuine need or just your ego?
  - What would happen if you were fully transparent right now?
  - Who are you tiptoeing around, and why?

      Pollack explores the card's dual nature — the trickster archetype as
      both creative and destructive. She connects it to the need for
      unconventional approaches.

    relevance: >
      Waite's description includes "endeavour, hope, confidence" alongside
      darker meanings — unusually ambivalent for such a clearly deceptive
      image.
