  meaning: >
    A farmer leans on his hoe, gazing at seven pentacles growing on a leafy
    vine. The planting is done, the tending is done — now comes the hardest
    part: waiting. This card appears when you've invested significant effort
    and must trust the process. Are the results worth what you've put in?
    The farmer isn't sure yet. Neither are you.

  keywords:
    - Impatience
    - Poor returns
    - Wasted effort
    - Quitting too soon
    - Bad investment
  meaning: >
    Reversed, the harvest disappoints or you lose patience before it arrives.
    Investments that don't pay off, effort that feels wasted, or the
    temptation to rip everything up and start over when the crop just needs
    more time. Sometimes the reversal is correct — not everything planted
    deserves to be harvested.
imagery:
  - element: Farmer leaning on a hoe
    significance: >
      The hoe is grounded — the work tool at rest. His posture is
      contemplative, not idle. This is active waiting, assessment, taking
      stock. He has done everything he can and now must let time do its
      part. The lean suggests weariness — long-term investment is tiring.
    tradition: Agricultural symbolism
  - element: Seven pentacles growing on a vine
    significance: >
      The coins grow like fruit — wealth here is organic, alive, still
      developing. Six cluster together while one sits lower, perhaps not
      yet ripe. The growth is real but uneven. Not every investment
      matures at the same rate.
    tradition: Agricultural / alchemical (growth as transformation)
  - element: Green leafy vine bearing the pentacles
    significance: >
      The vine connects earth to fruit — labor to result. But vines
      grow on their own schedule. You can plant, water, and tend, but
      you cannot make them hurry. The card's central lesson is encoded
      in the plant itself.
    tradition: Biblical (vineyard parables) / agricultural
  - element: Tilled earth at the farmer's feet
    significance: >
      The ground has been worked — evidence of past effort. This isn't
      wild growth but cultivated harvest. The farmer's investment is
      visible in the soil itself.
    tradition: Elemental — Earth worked by human hands

  numerology: >
    7 — reflection, assessment, the pause before completion. Seven is
    the contemplative number, the Sabbath. In Pentacles, seven is the
    farmer surveying his field — work paused for evaluation.
  colors:
    - Green (growth, the vine, living investment)
    - Gold (the pentacles — value still ripening)
    - Brown (earth, soil, the ground of effort)
connections:

    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      The Seven waits; the Eight works. After assessment comes renewed
      dedication. If the Seven decides the investment is worthwhile,
      the Eight provides the diligent effort to see it through.

    description: >
      The Hermit also pauses to reflect and assess the journey so far.
      The Seven of Pentacles is the Hermit's energy applied to material
      investments — stepping back to see clearly.

    relationship: echo
    description: >
      Both Sevens involve standing one's ground. The Seven of Wands
      defends a position actively; the Seven of Pentacles holds a
      position through patience. Different kinds of perseverance.
themes:
  - "The patience of the farmer — trusting processes you can't accelerate"
  - "Assessment without action — the wisdom of the pause"
  - "Sunk cost and future value — knowing when to wait and when to walk away"
questions:
  - "What have you invested in that's still growing — and do you trust the process?"
  - "Are you waiting patiently or just avoiding a decision?"
  - "If the harvest is smaller than expected, will the effort still have been worth it?"
  - "What would you do differently if you planted this field again?"

    relevance: "Waite describes the figure as contemplating his treasure with 'some satisfaction' — but the image suggests more ambivalence than he admits."
