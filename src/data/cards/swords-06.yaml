    - Mental shift
  meaning: >
    A cloaked figure and child are ferried across water, six swords standing
    upright in the bow. This is the quiet departure — no drama, no fanfare,
    just the slow movement away from turbulent waters toward calmer ones. You're
    not healed yet, but you're moving in the right direction.

  keywords:
    - Stuck in the past
    - Resistance to change
    - Unfinished business
    - Return to troubled waters
    - Delayed departure
  meaning: >
    Reversed, the boat turns back or never leaves the shore. You know you need
    to move on but can't — or you've tried to leave a bad situation only to
    find yourself drawn back. The baggage (those six swords) is too heavy, or
    the familiar pain feels safer than unknown waters.
imagery:
  - element: Cloaked figure and small child in a boat
    significance: >
      A parent protecting a child during transition — vulnerability in motion.
      The cloak hides the face, suggesting grief or the desire to leave
      identity behind. The child represents what is worth saving from the
      wreckage.
    tradition: RWS narrative — exile and passage motifs
  - element: Six swords standing in the bow of the boat
    significance: >
      The swords travel with them — you carry your thoughts, your pain, your
      knowledge to the new shore. Moving on doesn't mean forgetting. The
      swords are planted upright, suggesting these truths have been
      acknowledged and ordered.
    tradition: Symbolic — baggage and lessons carried forward
  - element: Turbulent water on the right, calm water on the left
    significance: >
      Smith painted the water rough on one side and smooth on the other —
      the journey literally moves from difficulty toward peace. The transition
      is visible in the water itself.
    tradition: RWS visual narrative
  - element: The ferryman guiding the boat
    significance: >
      A guide who assists the passage — a therapist, a friend, someone who
      helps you cross. You don't have to make this journey alone. Echoes of
      Charon, but toward life rather than death.
    tradition: Greek mythology — Charon / river crossing

  numerology: >
    6 — harmony, balance, the hexagram. After the Five's destruction, six
    finds equilibrium through movement. Not static peace but dynamic
    rebalancing — you heal by traveling.
  colors:
    - Grey-blue (water — emotion in transit)
    - Muted earth tones (the cloak — mourning, humility)

    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      After the Five's bitter conflict, the Six departs. This is what comes
      after the fight — not resolution, but removal. Sometimes the wisest
      response to a toxic situation is to leave it.
  - card: cups-06
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Six of Cups looks back to the past with nostalgia; the Six of Swords
      leaves the past behind with resignation. Both sixes deal with memory —
      one sweetly, one with sorrow.
  - card: major-18
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Moon shows a long path through darkness; the Six of Swords shows
      passage across dark water. Both depict the journey through difficulty
      where you can't see the destination yet.
themes:
  - "Transition as a form of healing — movement itself as medicine"
  - "The courage to leave without knowing where you're going"
  - "Carrying your wounds forward rather than leaving them behind"
  - "Quiet departures — not every ending is dramatic"
questions:
  - What shore are you leaving, and can you name what you're carrying with you?
  - Who has helped ferry you through a difficult transition?
  - Are you moving toward something or just away from something?
  - What would you need to leave behind to make the crossing lighter?
