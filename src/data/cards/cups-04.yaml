  meaning: >
    A young man sits under a tree with arms crossed, staring at three cups on
    the ground while a fourth is offered by a hand from a cloud. He doesn't
    see it — or doesn't care. This is the restlessness that comes when what
    you have no longer satisfies, but you haven't yet figured out what you
    actually want.

  keywords:
    - Renewed motivation
    - Accepting an opportunity
    - Breaking free of apathy
    - Sudden awareness
    - Gratitude
  meaning: >
    The spell of indifference breaks. You finally see the cup being offered
    and reach for it — or you realize the three cups you already have are
    enough. Reversed can mark the moment apathy lifts and engagement returns.
    Sometimes simply: you were right to refuse, and now you know why.
imagery:
  - element: Young man sitting under a tree, arms crossed
    significance: >
      Withdrawal into contemplation — or stubbornness disguised as meditation.
      The crossed arms are defensive, closed. He's turned inward, and the tree
      suggests Buddha under the Bodhi tree, but without the enlightenment.
      This is the stage before insight, where dissatisfaction hasn't yet
      become wisdom.
    tradition: Buddhist parallel / psychological withdrawal
  - element: Hand emerging from cloud offering a fourth cup
    significance: >
      The same divine hand that offers the Aces — grace arriving unsolicited.
      But unlike the Aces, this offering is ignored or unseen. The universe
      presents an opportunity; the question is whether you're too lost in
      your own discontent to notice it.
    tradition: Christian mysticism / RWS Ace imagery
  - element: Three cups arranged on the ground before him
    significance: >
      What he already has — emotional experiences, relationships, or gifts
      he's taking for granted. They're stable (the number four suggests
      structure) but uninspiring. The problem isn't scarcity; it's boredom.
    tradition: Numerological — stability tipping into stagnation
  - element: Hilly, green landscape
    significance: >
      The setting is pleasant but unremarkable — there's nothing wrong here.
      That's the point. Discontent doesn't require suffering; sometimes the
      most paralyzing restlessness comes when everything is fine.
    tradition: Pastoral

  numerology: >
    4 — stability, structure, consolidation. In the emotional realm, stability
    can become stagnation. The four walls of a room can be a foundation or a
    prison, depending on whether the door is open.
  colors:
    - Green (the landscape — growth stalled)
    - Brown (earth, groundedness tipping into inertia)
    - Grey (clouds, emotional flatness)

    description: >
      After the celebration of the Three comes the hangover of the Four.
      The joy of community gives way to solitary contemplation — what now?

    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      If the Four is discontent before loss, the Five is grief after it.
      The Four still has all its cups; the Five has already spilled three.
  - card: swords-04
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      Both Fours depict withdrawal and rest. The Four of Swords is
      deliberate recovery; the Four of Cups is unproductive brooding.
      Same posture, different relationship to stillness.
  - card: major-12
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Hanged Man also shows voluntary withdrawal leading to changed
      perspective. The Four of Cups is the early stage of that process —
      before the surrender that makes insight possible.
themes:
  - Apathy as a message — discontent pointing toward something that needs to change
  - The missed offering — grace that arrives when you're not looking
  - Satiation vs. satisfaction — having enough but not feeling enough
  - Contemplation vs. avoidance — the fine line between reflection and withdrawal
questions:
  - What opportunity might you be ignoring because you're focused on what you lack?
  - Is your current restlessness a signal to change, or an invitation to look deeper at what you have?
  - When has boredom or apathy actually preceded a breakthrough?
  - What would you see if you uncrossed your arms and looked up?

    relevance: >
      Pollack reads this card as a necessary withdrawal — not pathological
      but preparatory. She connects it to the spiritual desert that precedes
      transformation.

      Waite's keyword is "blended pleasure" — satisfaction mixed with
      ennui. His description hints that the figure's contemplation may
      lead somewhere productive.
