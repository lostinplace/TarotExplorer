  keywords:
    - Expansion
    - Foresight
    - Enterprise
    - Exploration
    - Progress
  meaning: >
    A figure stands on a cliff overlooking the sea, watching ships sail toward
    the horizon. The plans made in the Two have been set in motion — this is
    the moment of committed expansion. You've launched something into the
    world and now wait with confidence for it to reach distant shores.

  keywords:
    - Delays in progress
    - Overextension
    - Failed expansion
    - Lack of foresight
    - Frustration
  meaning: >
    The ships don't come back, or the horizon feels empty. Plans hit unexpected
    obstacles, or you expanded too fast without adequate preparation. Can also
    suggest a reluctance to think big — limiting yourself to what's comfortable
    rather than reaching for what's possible.
imagery:
  - element: Figure with back turned, gazing at the sea
    significance: >
      Unlike the Two, this figure faces outward — fully committed to the
      horizon. His back is to us, to safety, to the known. This posture
      is confidence: he's not second-guessing, he's watching his vision
      unfold.
    tradition: RWS scenic convention — orientation as psychological state
  - element: Three wands planted in the ground
    significance: >
      The three wands are stable, rooted — the vision has structure now.
      One wand is held by the figure (active will), two are planted
      (established resources or partnerships). The triangle of three
      suggests the first stable form.
    tradition: Numerological — three as synthesis and first stability
  - element: Ships sailing on golden sea
    significance: >
      Commerce, trade, ventures sent out into the world. The ships
      represent projects or efforts that have left your hands — you've
      committed resources and now await returns. The golden light
      suggests optimism about the outcome.
    tradition: RWS — ships as enterprise and long-range ventures
  - element: Elevated cliff vantage point
    significance: >
      Height represents perspective and foresight. This figure can see
      further than those at sea level — strategic vision that allows
      anticipation of what's coming.
    tradition: Elemental — Fire's association with vision and aspiration
correspondences:
  element: Fire

  tree_of_life: "Binah (Understanding) — vision given form and structure"
  numerology: >
    3 — synthesis, the first fruit of creation. One became two (duality),
    and two becomes three (resolution). In Wands, the creative spark has
    been given direction and now produces its first tangible expansion.
  colors:
