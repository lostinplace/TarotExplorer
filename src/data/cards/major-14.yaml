    - Harmony
    - Integration
  meaning: >
    Temperance pours between two cups, finding the perfect blend. This is the
    art of balance — combining opposites, practicing patience, walking the
    middle path. After Death's dramatic clearing, Temperance carefully
    reconstitutes what remains into something new and harmonious. This is
    alchemy: not destroying, but transforming through careful combination.

  keywords:
    - Imbalance
    - Excess
    - Impatience
    - Discord
    - Forced integration
  meaning: >
    Reversed, Temperance signals excess and imbalance. Too much of a good
    thing, impatience, or forcing incompatible elements together. You may be
    trying to rush a process that requires time, or refusing to blend aspects
    of yourself that need integration. The mixture curdles when you don't
    respect the proportions.
imagery:
  - element: Winged angel pouring water between two cups
    significance: >
      The angel — often identified as Michael or Raphael — pours a liquid
      between two golden cups in a stream that defies gravity, flowing upward
      from the lower cup. This impossible pour is the point: the mixing of
      opposites transcends physical law. Conscious and unconscious, spirit
      and matter, are blended through patience and skill.
    tradition: Alchemical (the Great Work) / Angelic hierarchy
  - element: One foot on land, one foot in water
    significance: >
      The angel stands at the boundary between solid earth and flowing water —
      between the conscious and unconscious, the fixed and the fluid. This
      liminal stance means Temperance operates between worlds, combining
      what normal experience keeps separate.
    tradition: Elemental symbolism / Liminal threshold
  - element: Triangle with a sun/square inside it on the angel's chest
    significance: >
      The triangle of fire (spirit) containing the square of matter — the
      alchemical formula for integrating spirit and matter. This glyph is the
      card's core equation: divine energy (triangle) expressed through
      material form (square). The goal of the Work.
    tradition: Alchemical / Hermetic geometry
  - element: Path leading to golden crown on the horizon between mountains
    significance: >
      A winding path leads from the pool toward distant mountains where a
      golden light (sometimes a crown or sun) gleams between two peaks. This
      is the long road of integration — the patient path that leads to
      illumination. No shortcuts; the path curves for a reason.
    tradition: Mystical geography / Pilgrim's path
  - element: Irises growing at the water's edge
    significance: >
      The iris flower is named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow — the
      bridge between heaven and earth. Irises at the threshold of water and
      land reinforce Temperance's role as mediator. The rainbow itself is
      white light separated into its components: analysis as the complement
      of synthesis.
    tradition: "Greek (Iris) / Floral symbolism"

  numerology: >
    14 — 1+4=5, the number of mediation (The Hierophant). But where 5
    mediates through doctrine, 14 mediates through direct experience and
    experimentation. The alchemist's number — combining and recombining
    until the proportion is right.
  colors:
    - Blue (water, unconscious, the receptive cup)
    - Gold (solar illumination, the alchemical goal)
    - Green (nature, growth, the irises)
    - White (angelic purity, the light being blended)

    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Lovers present a choice between opposites; Temperance blends them.
      Both feature an angel — in The Lovers, the angel blesses a union; in
      Temperance, the angel performs the union directly.
  - card: major-13
    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      Death clears the ground; Temperance rebuilds. After the old form dies,
      the new form must be carefully assembled from what remains. Destruction
      followed by patient reconstruction.
  - card: major-21
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The World completes what Temperance begins — full integration, the
      dance of wholeness. Temperance is the process; The World is the result.
  - card: major-15
    relationship: polarity
    description: >
      Temperance and The Devil are the angel and the demon — integration versus
      bondage, patience versus compulsion. Temperance blends freely; The Devil
      chains what should be separate.
themes:
  - "The middle way — Buddhist, Aristotelian, and alchemical paths between extremes"
  - "Process over product — the insight that how you get there matters as much as arriving"
  - "Integration as healing — the therapeutic reunion of split-off parts of the self"
  - "Alchemy as metaphor — the transformation of base experience into golden wisdom"
questions:
  - "What aspects of yourself are you keeping separate that might be more powerful combined?"
  - "Where in your life do you need more patience with a process that can't be rushed?"
  - "What's the difference between compromise and integration — are you settling or synthesizing?"
  - "What extremes are you bouncing between that might have a middle path?"

    author: Arthur Edward Waite
    relevance: >
      Waite describes the angel as pouring "the essences of life" between the
      cups. He emphasizes the path to the crown on the horizon — the long
      journey of spiritual refinement.

  - title: Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom
    author: Rachel Pollack
    relevance: >
      Pollack reads Temperance as the card of healing after Death's crisis.
      Her treatment of the alchemical symbolism — especially the triangle
      and square on the angel's robe — is particularly useful.

    author: Aleister Crowley
    relevance: >
      Crowley renamed this card "Art" and made the alchemical dimension
      explicit — his version shows the actual chemical wedding. Useful for
      understanding the card's alchemical subtext.
