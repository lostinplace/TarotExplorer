    - Conflict
    - Defeat
    - Hollow victory
    - Dishonor
    - Winning at a cost
  meaning: >
    A smirking figure collects swords from the ground while two others walk away
    in defeat. But look at his face — is this victory? The Five of Swords is
    the win that costs you everything worth winning: relationships, integrity,
    respect. You got what you wanted and lost what mattered.

  keywords:
    - Reconciliation
    - Moving past conflict
    - Lingering resentment
    - Desire to make amends
    - Choosing not to fight
  meaning: >
    Reversed, the battle is over and the question is what comes next. Either
    you're ready to lay down arms and attempt reconciliation, or the resentment
    from past conflict continues to poison the present. Can you walk away, or
    are you still collecting swords?
imagery:
  - element: Central figure holding three swords with a smirk
    significance: >
      The "winner" — but Smith paints his expression as cruel, not triumphant.
      He holds three swords (more than he can use), suggesting greed or the
      need to dominate beyond necessity. Winning wasn't enough; he needed
      the others to lose.
    tradition: RWS psychological portraiture
  - element: Two retreating figures in the background
    significance: >
      The defeated walk away — toward the turbulent water and storm. Their
      postures convey dejection, but they're also leaving the toxic dynamic.
      Sometimes losing means getting free.
    tradition: Narrative scene composition
  - element: Jagged clouds and choppy water
    significance: >
      The sky is disturbed, the water turbulent. The environment reflects the
      emotional aftermath of conflict — nothing is at peace, not even the
      "victor." The Air element is agitated.
    tradition: Elemental — disturbed Air
  - element: Two swords left on the ground
    significance: >
      The defeated dropped their swords — they surrendered or were disarmed.
      The winner picks them up as trophies. The empty ground between the
      figures is the relationship that was destroyed.
    tradition: RWS narrative symbolism

  numerology: >

    In Swords, five is the argument that cannot be resolved, the battle
    where everyone loses something.

    - Red (hints of anger, aggression)

    description: >
      After the Four's rest, conflict erupts again. The mind that was
      healing is now weaponized — rest was either insufficient or the
      lesson wasn't learned.
  - card: wands-05
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      Both Fives depict conflict, but the Five of Wands is competitive
      sport — messy but not malicious. The Five of Swords is genuinely
      cruel. Wands fight for position; Swords fight to destroy.
  - card: major-16
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      Both cards tear things apart. The Tower is impersonal cosmic
      destruction; the Five of Swords is personal, chosen, petty
      destruction.
themes:
  - "Pyrrhic victory — winning in a way that makes you the loser"
  - "The ethics of conflict — when fighting itself is the defeat"
  - "Ego versus integrity"
  - "The aftermath of cruelty"
questions:
  - What have you won that you're not proud of winning?
  - Is this conflict worth what it's costing you?
  - Who walked away from you because you had to be right?
  - Can you tell the difference between strength and dominance?

  - title: Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom
    author: Rachel Pollack
    relevance: >
      Pollack's reading focuses on the moral dimension — she asks who the
      querent identifies with (the winner or the losers) and what that
      reveals.

  - title: The Pictorial Key to the Tarot
    author: Arthur Edward Waite
    relevance: >
      Waite lists "degradation, destruction, dishonor" — remarkably harsh
      language that confirms this is not a positive card in any orientation.
