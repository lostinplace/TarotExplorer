  meaning: >
    A shadowy figure gazes up at seven cups floating in a cloud, each
    containing a different vision — jewels, a wreath, a castle, a dragon,
    a veiled figure, a serpent, a glowing head. This is the seductive
    paralysis of too many options, or imagination untethered from reality.
    Not all that glitters is gold, and not all these cups contain what
    they promise.

  keywords:
    - Clarity of purpose
    - Cutting through illusion
    - Determined choice
    - Overwhelm
    - Disillusionment
  meaning: >
    The fog clears. You see through the fantasies and make a concrete choice,
    or the illusions collapse and you're left with reality — which may be
    disappointing but is at least solid. Can also indicate overwhelm from
    too many options, leading to complete withdrawal rather than decision.
imagery:
  - element: Silhouetted figure gazing up at floating cups in clouds
    significance: >
      The figure is in shadow — undefined, unclear even to themselves. They
      gaze upward rather than forward, lost in possibility rather than engaged
      with reality. The cloud supporting the cups tells you these visions
      have no foundation.
    tradition: Dream/vision iconography
  - element: Seven cups each containing a different vision
    significance: >
      Each cup holds a different desire or fear — wealth (jewels), victory
      (wreath), security (castle), fear (dragon/serpent), beauty (veiled
      figure), illumination (glowing head). They represent the full
      spectrum of what the imagination can conjure when untethered. Some
      are gifts, some are traps, and you can't tell which is which.
    tradition: Hermetic — the seven classical planets as seven desires
  - element: The dragon emerging from one cup
    significance: >
      Not all fantasies are pleasant. Among the treasures and laurels lurks
      a dragon — fear, danger, the shadow side of desire. Fantasy includes
      anxiety as much as wish-fulfillment. The imagination doesn't
      discriminate between hopes and terrors.
    tradition: Alchemical — the dragon as untransformed prima materia
  - element: Clouds surrounding and supporting the cups
    significance: >
      Nothing here is grounded. Clouds are the traditional symbol of
      illusion, the veil between the seen and unseen. These cups float
      because they're not real yet — they're projections, not possessions.
    tradition: Elemental — Air/Water boundary as illusion

  tree_of_life: "Netzach (7 — Victory)"
  numerology: >
    7 — introspection, spiritual seeking, the inner journey. Sevens across
    all suits involve an internal challenge. In Cups, the challenge is
    discernment — separating genuine desire from fantasy, vision from
    delusion.
  colors:
    - Grey (fog, confusion, the undefined)
    - Gold (alluring treasures, false promises)
    - Black (shadow, the unknown figure)
connections:
  - card: cups-06
    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      The Six's nostalgia tips into the Seven's fantasy. Pleasant memories
      become projections, and looking backward becomes dreaming forward
      without grounding.
  - card: cups-08
    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      The Eight is the response to the Seven — walking away from illusion
      in search of something real. The disillusionment that follows fantasy.
  - card: major-18
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Moon also deals with illusion, fear, and the deceptive landscape
      of the unconscious. The Seven of Cups is the personal, everyday
      version — the Moon is the full nocturnal journey.
  - card: swords-07
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      Both Sevens involve deception. The Seven of Swords deceives others;
      the Seven of Cups deceives yourself. One is strategy; the other
      is self-delusion.
themes:
  - Imagination as double-edged — creative vision vs. escapist fantasy
  - The paradox of choice — too many options as a form of paralysis
  - Desire unexamined — wanting without knowing why
  - Discernment — the discipline of separating real from unreal
questions:
  - Which of your current desires are genuine, and which are fantasies you'd never actually want if they materialized?
  - Where are you substituting daydreaming for action?
  - What would clarity look like right now — if you could only choose one cup, which would it be?
  - What are you afraid to see clearly?

      Pollack catalogs each of the seven visions and their possible meanings,
      reading them as a map of human desire. She connects the card to the

    relevance: >
      Waite lists "fairy favours, images of reflection, imagination" —
      note his emphasis on reflection and imagination as both gift and
      danger. His divinatory meanings include "desire, will, determination"
      alongside the illusions.
