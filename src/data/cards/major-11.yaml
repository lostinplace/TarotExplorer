    - Fairness
    - Truth
    - Cause and effect
    - Law
    - Accountability
  meaning: >
    Justice holds the scales and the sword — truth will out, and consequences
    follow actions. This card demands honesty, accountability, and fair dealing.
    It's not about punishment; it's about the impartial logic of cause and
    effect. What you have put into motion will return to you in kind.

  keywords:
    - Unfairness
    - Dishonesty
    - Lack of accountability
    - Bias
    - Self-deception
  meaning: >
    Reversed, Justice warns of corruption, dishonesty, or avoiding
    responsibility. The scales are tipped — something is unfair and needs
    addressing. Can also point inward: where are you lying to yourself? What
    consequences are you refusing to acknowledge?
imagery:
  - element: Seated figure holding scales in left hand
    significance: >
      The scales are held in the receptive hand — Justice receives evidence
      before acting. They are perfectly level, suggesting that the weighing
      is still happening, or that true balance has been achieved. The scales
      measure not just actions but intentions, not just outcomes but the
      truth behind them.
    tradition: Egyptian (Ma'at's feather) / Greco-Roman (Themis/Justitia)
  - element: Double-edged sword in right hand, raised vertically
    significance: >
      The sword of discernment — it cuts both ways, showing that truth
      applies equally to all parties. Raised straight up, not tilted: justice
      is not yet decided but ready to act. The sword is the active complement
      to the passive scales. First weigh, then cut.
    tradition: Cardinal virtue tradition / Judicial iconography
  - element: Red robe and green mantle
    significance: >
      Red for action and passion restrained by duty; the green mantle
      visible beneath suggests growth and the living world that justice
      serves. Justice is not cold abstraction — it operates in the realm
      of living consequences.
    tradition: Virtue allegory / Color symbolism
  - element: Veil between two grey pillars
    significance: >
      Like The High Priestess, Justice sits between two pillars with a veil
      behind. But where the Priestess guards the unconscious, Justice guards
      the moral order. The veil suggests that ultimate justice is partially
      hidden — we see its operation but not always its full logic.
    tradition: Kabbalistic (pillars of severity and mercy) / Judicial
  - element: Crown with a square jewel
    significance: >
      The square represents earthly order, the four elements in balance,
      material reality structured by law. The crown is authority — but
      earned through adherence to principle, not personal power. Justice's
      authority comes from the system, not the individual.
    tradition: Royal / Geometric symbolism

  numerology: >
    11 — the first master number, a doubled one. Duality in balance, two
    pillars, two pans of the scales. Eleven is also the number that exceeds
    the complete cycle of ten — justice that transcends ordinary reckoning.
  colors:
    - Red (action, consequence, the blood of accountability)
    - Green (growth, the living world justice protects)
    - Grey (impartiality, the stone of law)
connections:

    relationship: polarity
    description: >
      Strength operates through mercy and patience; Justice operates through
      severity and precision. The two great powers of the middle pillar —
      one bends, the other cuts. Both are necessary; neither is sufficient alone.
  - card: major-20
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      Judgement is Justice at a cosmic scale — the final accounting, the
      trumpet call that transcends human law. Justice weighs in this life;
      Judgement weighs across all lives.
  - card: major-04
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Emperor establishes law through personal authority; Justice
      administers it through impersonal principle. The lawgiver and the judge —
      one creates the rules, the other applies them.
  - card: major-12
    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      After Justice comes The Hanged Man — the suspension of normal judgment.
      Having confronted the truth (11), you must surrender your perspective
      entirely (12) to see what truth looks like inverted.
themes:
  - "Karma — the moral causation that operates regardless of belief"
  - "Radical honesty — the cost of truth and the higher cost of avoiding it"
  - "The difference between justice and vengeance — one restores balance, the other perpetuates imbalance"
  - "Moral complexity — what happens when fairness to one party means harm to another"
questions:
  - "What truth are you avoiding because the consequences feel too heavy?"
  - "Where in your life are you expecting different results without changing your actions?"
  - "If you were judged by your actions rather than your intentions, how would the verdict read?"
  - "What would genuine accountability — not punishment, but honest reckoning — look like right now?"

    author: Arthur Edward Waite
    relevance: >
      Waite moved Justice from position VIII to XI to align with Golden Dawn
      Libra attributions. His commentary emphasizes justice of the cosmic
      rather than legal kind.

  - title: Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom
    author: Rachel Pollack
    relevance: >
      Pollack's reading frames Justice as the card of absolute truth — not
      negotiable, not relative. Her treatment of the card's position as the
      exact center of the Major Arcana (11 of 22) is structurally insightful.

      Aristotle's distinction between distributive and corrective justice
      provides philosophical depth for understanding what the card's "balance"
      actually means in practice.
