  meaning: >
    A crowned figure sits rigidly, clutching four pentacles — one balanced on
    his head, one pressed to his chest, two pinned under his feet. He has
    achieved stability but at the cost of freedom. Every limb is occupied
    with holding on. The card asks: is this security or imprisonment?

  keywords:
    - Generosity
    - Release
    - Financial insecurity
    - Reckless spending
    - Letting go
  meaning: >
    Reversed, the grip loosens — either through conscious generosity or
    forced loss. At best, learning that true security comes from flow, not
    hoarding. At worst, reckless spending or losing what you clung to
    precisely because you held it too tightly.
imagery:
  - element: Figure with pentacle balanced on crown of head
    significance: >
      The coin on his head suggests that material concerns dominate his
      thinking — wealth has become his identity. He wears it like a crown,
      but it weighs him down. His worldview is defined by what he owns.
    tradition: Symbolic posture / body-mind correspondence
  - element: Pentacle clutched to chest
    significance: >
      He holds wealth against his heart — protecting it emotionally,
      identifying with it personally. Losing money would feel like losing
      himself. The embrace is possessive, not loving.
    tradition: Body symbolism
  - element: Two pentacles under his feet
    significance: >
      Standing on his wealth gives him a foundation but also roots him
      in place. He cannot walk, cannot move, cannot dance like the figure
      in the Two. Stability has become stagnation.
    tradition: Elemental symbolism — Earth at its most fixed
  - element: City visible in the background, figure sitting apart
    significance: >
      The city represents community, commerce, social life — everything
      the figure has withdrawn from. His wealth has isolated him. He sits
      outside the walls, alone with his coins.
    tradition: Social symbolism

  tree_of_life: "Chesed (Mercy) — abundance structured into rigidity in Earth"
  numerology: >
    4 — stability, structure, enclosure. Four walls, four corners, a box.
    In Pentacles, four becomes the fortress that protects but also confines.
    The most stable number, and the most resistant to change.
  colors:
    - Black (rigidity, isolation, the closed self)
    - Gold (the pentacles — wealth as both blessing and burden)
    - Grey (the stone seat, the city — cold permanence)
connections:
  - card: pentacles-02
    relationship: polarity
    description: >
      The Two dances with change; the Four resists it absolutely. Both manage
      material resources, but the Two flows while the Four locks down.
  - card: pentacles-06
    relationship: polarity
    description: >
      The Four hoards; the Six gives. They represent opposing responses to
      the question of what to do with wealth — clutch it or distribute it.

    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Emperor also establishes order and control through the number four.
      But the Emperor builds a kingdom; the Four of Pentacles builds a cage.
      Same structure, different scale and intention.
themes:
  - "The prison of possession — when what you own begins to own you"
  - "Security versus freedom — the cost of holding on"
  - "Scarcity mindset — fear masquerading as prudence"
  - "Healthy boundaries versus unhealthy walls"
questions:
  - "What are you holding so tightly that you can't use your hands for anything else?"
  - "Is your need for financial security protecting you or isolating you?"
  - "What would you do differently if you trusted that more would come?"

    relevance: "Waite's description is notably brief and dry — the image speaks for itself. Note the posture he specifies."
