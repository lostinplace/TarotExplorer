    - Conflict
    - Competition
    - Creative tension
    - Struggle
    - Rivalry
  meaning: >
    Five figures brandish wands in a chaotic skirmish — but look closer: no one
    is being hit. This is competition, not war. The clash of ideas, the jostle
    for position, the creative friction that happens when multiple wills collide.
    Uncomfortable but generative.

  keywords:
    - Avoidance of conflict
    - Inner struggle
    - Compromise
    - Suppressed competition
    - Resolution
  meaning: >
    The conflict moves inward or is avoided entirely. You may be dodging a
    necessary confrontation, swallowing frustration to keep the peace, or
    fighting yourself instead of engaging with others. Can also indicate
    the resolution of a dispute — the wands finally lowered.
imagery:
  - element: Five figures with raised wands, no clear formation
    significance: >
      The chaos is the point. No one leads, no one follows, everyone pushes
      their own agenda. This is creative disorder — the brainstorm before
      the breakthrough, the argument that precedes alignment. Note that no
      one appears genuinely injured.
    tradition: RWS — conflict as developmental stage
  - element: Different colored clothing on each figure
    significance: >
      Each figure is dressed differently, suggesting diverse perspectives,
      backgrounds, or approaches. The conflict arises from difference, not
      malice. These aren't enemies — they're individuals who haven't yet
      found common ground.
    tradition: RWS scenic detail — costume as identity
  - element: Barren, flat ground
    significance: >
      No landscape features, no buildings, no trees — just open ground.
      The stripped-down setting focuses attention entirely on the human
      dynamics. There's no shelter, no hierarchy, no structure to impose
      order. The figures must sort it out themselves.
    tradition: RWS scenic convention — minimal landscape as raw state

  numerology: >
    5 — disruption, instability, the breaking of the Four's structure.
    Fives across all suits introduce challenge. In Wands, this is the
    productive friction of competing creative energies.
  colors:
    - Multiple bright colors (diversity, chaos, individuality)
    - Yellow-green (the open ground, unresolved energy)

      The Four's celebration gives way to the Five's conflict — after
      harmony comes the inevitable clash of differing visions. Growth
      requires disruption.
  - card: swords-05
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      Both Fives involve conflict, but the Five of Swords is cruel and
      produces losers. The Five of Wands is rowdy but constructive — no
      one walks away defeated.

    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      The Six of Wands resolves the Five's conflict — one figure emerges
      victorious, recognized by the crowd. Competition finds its winner.
themes:

  - "Competition without malice — the difference between rivalry and enmity"
  - "The chaos before order — breakthrough requires disruption"
questions:
  - "Where in your life is conflict actually productive, even if uncomfortable?"
  - "Are you avoiding a confrontation that needs to happen?"
