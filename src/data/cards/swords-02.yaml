  keywords:
    - Indecision
    - Stalemate
    - Avoidance
    - Blocked emotions
    - Willful blindness
  meaning: >
    A blindfolded figure sits before a body of water, two swords crossed
    defensively over the heart. This is not peace — it is the tense stillness
    of refusing to choose. The blindfold is voluntary: you already know the
    truth but won't look at it because looking means deciding, and deciding
    means losing something.
reversed:
  keywords:
    - Information overload
    - Forced choice
    - Emotional release
    - Overthinking
    - Seeing what you avoided
  meaning: >
    The blindfold slips. What was carefully held in balance comes crashing down
    — you're forced to confront what you've been avoiding. This can be
    overwhelming but ultimately freeing. Sometimes the reversed Two indicates
    lies exposed or a decision made under duress.
imagery:
  - element: Blindfolded woman on a stone bench
    significance: >
      The blindfold is self-imposed — this is not Justice's impartial balance
      but a deliberate refusal to see. The stone bench suggests rigidity; she
      has made immobility her fortress. She is alone with her avoidance.
    tradition: Classical — Lady Justice inverted
  - element: Two swords crossed over the chest
    significance: >
      The swords form an X over the heart — the intellect blocking access to
      feeling. The arms are crossed defensively. This is the mind protecting
      itself from emotional truth by refusing to process it.
    tradition: Elemental — Air suppressing Water
  - element: Crescent moon in the upper right
    significance: >
      The waxing crescent suggests something growing — intuition, hidden
      knowledge, or the truth that will eventually force itself into view.
      The moon sees what the blindfolded figure won't.
    tradition: Astrological — Moon in Libra (card's decan)
  - element: Rocky islands jutting from calm water
    significance: >
      The water (emotion, unconscious) appears calm on the surface, but hidden
      obstacles lurk beneath. The peace is deceptive — you just can't see the
      rocks with the blindfold on.
    tradition: Elemental symbolism

  tree_of_life: Chokmah (Wisdom) — the first division, duality emerging from unity
  numerology: >
    2 — polarity, choice, division. The first number that implies an "other."
    In Swords, two creates the dilemma: if there's one truth, there's also
    its opposite.
  colors:
    - Grey (ambiguity, the refusal to commit)
    - Blue (water, suppressed emotion)
    - White (the gown — false innocence, the pretense of neutrality)
connections:
  - card: major-02
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The High Priestess also sits between two pillars with hidden knowledge.
      But where the Priestess chooses receptive mystery, the Two of Swords
      chooses avoidance. Same posture, opposite wisdom.
  - card: major-11
    relationship: polarity
    description: >
      Justice is blindfolded to be impartial; the Two of Swords is blindfolded
      to avoid choosing. Justice weighs; the Two refuses to weigh.
  - card: swords-01
    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      The Ace's clear singular truth immediately splits into two in the Two —
      the first complication of pure intellect is that it reveals opposing
      truths.
themes:
  - "The cost of avoidance — not choosing is itself a choice"
  - "Emotional armoring — using intellect to block feeling"
  - "The false peace of stalemate"
  - "Willful blindness as self-protection"
questions:
  - What decision are you pretending doesn't exist?
  - What would you have to feel if you took the blindfold off?
  - Where in your life have you mistaken paralysis for patience?
  - What are you defending yourself from knowing?

    relevance: >
      Waite emphasizes "conformity" and "courage" — hinting that the balance
      shown is not stable equilibrium but fearful rigidity.

      crossed over the heart as a defense mechanism against feeling.
