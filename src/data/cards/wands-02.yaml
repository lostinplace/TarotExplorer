    - Bold decisions
  meaning: >
    A figure stands on a castle wall holding a small globe, gazing out at the
    vast landscape beyond. The initial spark has been caught — now comes the
    moment of decision. This is the space between inspiration and action, where
    vision meets strategy. The world is literally in your hands.

  keywords:
    - Fear of the unknown
    - Lack of planning
    - Playing it safe
    - Indecision
    - Small thinking
  meaning: >
    The globe feels too heavy, or the horizon too vast. You may be clinging to
    safety, afraid to leave what you've already built. Can also indicate poor
    planning — grand vision without the strategic thinking to support it, or
    partnership friction over direction.
imagery:
  - element: Figure holding a small globe
    significance: >
      The world held in one hand — dominion over possibility. This is not
      passive daydreaming; it's the confident assessment of someone who knows
      they have the resources to act. The globe represents the scope of
      ambition: not local, but expansive.
    tradition: RWS symbolic — mastery and worldly ambition
  - element: Two wands — one held, one mounted on the wall
    significance: >
      The held wand represents active will; the mounted wand represents
      established power or resources already in place. Together they suggest
      a choice point — use what you have, or reach for more.
    tradition: Numerological — duality, choice, partnership
  - element: Castle battlements
    significance: >
      The figure has already achieved something — a position of security and
      elevation. But he's looking outward, not inward. The castle is a
      launching point, not a destination. The question is whether comfort
      will become a trap.
    tradition: RWS scenic convention — elevation as achieved perspective
  - element: Red roses and lilies on the wall
    significance: >
      Roses (passion, desire) and lilies (purity, higher purpose) — the dual
      motivations behind ambition. The same flowers appear in The Magician's
      garden, linking this card to conscious creative will.
    tradition: Hermetic — rose and lily as passion and purity

  numerology: >
    2 — duality, polarity, the first division. In Wands, this is the moment
    where the single spark of the Ace splits into vision and plan, self and
    world, here and there.
  colors:
    - Red (Mars, passion, will)
    - Orange (ambition, warmth, fire)
    - Grey stone (structure, achieved position)
connections:
  - card: wands-01
    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      The Ace is the spark; the Two is the first conscious act of directing
      that spark. You've caught the inspiration — now what do you do with it?
  - card: wands-03
    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      The Three of Wands shows the figure who acted on the Two's vision —
      now watching ships sail toward the horizon. Planning has become
      commitment and expansion.
  - card: major-01
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Magician's roses and lilies reappear here. Both cards involve
      conscious direction of will toward manifestation, though the Two of
      Wands is more specifically about strategic choice.
themes:
  - "The courage of the first step — vision that demands action"
  - "Dominion and choice — holding the world and deciding what to do with it"
  - "Comfort versus growth — the castle as both achievement and potential cage"
questions:
  - "What vision are you holding but not yet acting on?"
  - "Where is safety keeping you from your next step?"
  - "If the world were literally in your hands, where would you point it?"

      Waite emphasizes the figure's dominion and the globe as representing
      worldly power. Note his phrase about the card's connection to boldness.
