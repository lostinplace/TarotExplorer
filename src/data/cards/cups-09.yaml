  meaning: >
    A well-fed figure sits before a curved display of nine cups, arms crossed
    in satisfaction. The "wish card" — what you wanted has arrived, and you
    can enjoy it. Physical comfort, emotional fulfillment, and the simple
    pleasure of having enough. Enjoy it without guilt.

  keywords:
    - Smugness
    - Materialism
    - Shallow satisfaction
    - Unfulfilled wishes
    - Overindulgence
  meaning: >
    The satisfaction curdles into smugness or reveals itself as hollow.
    Getting what you wished for and finding it doesn't fill the deeper
    need. Can indicate overindulgence, hedonism without meaning, or the
    uncomfortable realization that material comfort isn't the same as
    happiness.
imagery:
  - element: Stout figure seated on a wooden bench, arms crossed, smiling
    significance: >
      Self-satisfaction embodied. The crossed arms echo the Four of Cups
      but here the posture is confident, not defensive. This person is
      pleased with themselves and wants you to know it. There's a
      performative quality — the satisfaction is being displayed.
    tradition: Genre painting — the contented merchant
  - element: Nine cups arranged in an arc on a draped shelf behind the figure
    significance: >
      A trophy display — emotional achievements lined up for admiration.
      The arc suggests a crown or halo of fulfilled desires. Nine is one
      short of ten (completion), hinting that this satisfaction, while
      real, may not be the final word.
    tradition: Numerological — nine as near-completion
  - element: Blue draped cloth covering the shelf
    significance: >
      The display is dressed up, presented. There's something theatrical
      about this arrangement — satisfaction as performance. The blue
      connects to water and emotion, but here it's fabric, not flowing
      water. Emotion has been captured, arranged, controlled.
    tradition: Theatrical / display symbolism

  tree_of_life: "Yesod (9 — Foundation)"
  numerology: >
    9 — attainment, fulfillment, the penultimate number. Nines represent
    the highest expression of their suit before completion. In Cups, this
    is emotional fulfillment at its peak — the wish granted, the desire
    satisfied.
  colors:
    - Gold (wealth, satisfaction, abundance)
    - Blue (emotional fulfillment)
    - White (the figure's clothing — comfort, ease)

    description: >
      The Eight walked away seeking something real; the Nine found it.
      The difficult journey leads to genuine satisfaction — not the
      hollow comfort that was abandoned, but something earned.

    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      The Nine is personal satisfaction; the Ten extends it to family
      and community. Individual contentment becomes shared joy.
  - card: pentacles-09
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      Both Nines depict solitary enjoyment of abundance. The Nine of
      Pentacles enjoys material independence; the Nine of Cups enjoys
      emotional fulfillment. Both ask: is solo satisfaction enough?

    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Wheel of Fortune reminds that all states are temporary. The
      Nine of Cups is a high point — Jupiter's bounty — but the wheel
      keeps turning.
themes:
  - The wish fulfilled — getting what you asked for, and what that really means
  - Earned pleasure — satisfaction that follows seeking and sacrifice
  - The display of happiness — the gap between feeling content and performing contentment
  - Enough — the rare and undervalued experience of having what you need
questions:
  - What did you once wish for that you now have — and have you stopped to enjoy it?
  - Is your current satisfaction genuine, or are you performing contentment?
  - What's the difference between having enough and having everything?
  - If this wish came true, what would you wish for next?
