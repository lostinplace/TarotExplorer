    - Abundance
    - Security
    - Manifestation
  meaning: >
    A divine hand extends from a cloud, offering a golden pentacle over a
    lush garden with an archway leading to distant mountains. This is the
    seed of material reality — a new opportunity for wealth, health, or
    tangible achievement. Unlike the other aces, this gift must be cultivated;
    the garden suggests the work has already begun.

  keywords:
    - Missed opportunity
    - Scarcity mindset
    - Instability
    - Poor planning
    - Greed
  meaning: >
    Reversed, the coin slips through fingers. A promising opportunity is
    missed through hesitation, poor planning, or fixation on the wrong kind
    of wealth. Can also indicate materialism — chasing money while the garden
    of real abundance goes untended.
imagery:
  - element: Hand emerging from cloud holding a golden pentacle
    significance: >
      The Hand of God — divine source offering material blessing. The pentacle
      is a disc inscribed with a pentagram, the five-pointed star representing
      spirit ruling over the four elements. Material wealth, properly understood,
      is a spiritual gift.
    tradition: Hermetic / Christian mystical
  - element: Garden with lilies and a hedge archway
    significance: >
      The cultivated garden represents Eden or Paradise — material abundance
      in its ideal form. The archway is a threshold; you must choose to walk
      through it. The lilies suggest purity of intention. This isn't wild
      nature but tended earth — wealth requires stewardship.
    tradition: Biblical / Alchemical (hortus conclusus)
  - element: Path leading to distant mountains
    significance: >
      The mountains represent long-term goals and higher aspirations. The path
      through the garden gate leads toward them — material opportunity is not
      the destination but the means to reach something greater.
    tradition: Landscape symbolism
  - element: Lush greenery and flowers
    significance: >
      Fertility, growth, the Earth element in its most abundant expression.
      Everything is blooming — the conditions are right. The question is
      whether you'll plant the seed being offered.
    tradition: Elemental symbolism

  numerology: >
    1 — unity, beginning, the undifferentiated potential before it takes form.
    The Ace is not yet wealth; it is the possibility of wealth.
  colors:
    - Gold (wealth, solar energy, value)
    - Green (growth, fertility, Earth element)
    - White (purity, spiritual origin of material gifts)
connections:
  - card: pentacles-10
    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      The Ace is the seed; the Ten is the harvest. What begins as a single
      opportunity in the Ace becomes generational wealth and legacy in the Ten.
      The entire suit's journey lives between these two cards.
  - card: cups-01
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      Both Aces offer gifts from the divine hand, but the Ace of Cups offers
      emotional/spiritual abundance while the Ace of Pentacles offers material
      abundance. Together they represent inner and outer prosperity.
  - card: major-21
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The World card represents completion and wholeness in all realms. The Ace
      of Pentacles is one facet of that — the material dimension of fulfillment,
      the garden within the dancer's wreath.
themes:
  - "Opportunity as seed — potential that requires cultivation, not just reception"
  - "The spiritual dimension of material life — wealth as a sacred trust"
  - "Beginnings that are already grounded — not dreaming but planting"
  - "The garden gate — thresholds you must choose to walk through"
questions:
  - "What opportunity is being offered to you right now that you haven't fully acknowledged?"
  - "How do you distinguish between genuine abundance and mere accumulation?"
  - "What would you build if you trusted that the resources would come?"
  - "Is your relationship with material security based on gratitude or anxiety?"
