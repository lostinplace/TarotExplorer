    - Fairness
    - Giving and receiving
    - Power dynamics
  meaning: >
    A wealthy merchant holds a balanced scale in one hand while distributing
    coins to two kneeling figures with the other. Generosity, fair exchange,
    the circulation of wealth. But look again — the scale measures, the
    kneeling figures are below him. Every act of giving also defines a power
    relationship. Who holds the scale?

  keywords:
    - Strings attached
    - Debt
    - One-sided generosity
    - Power imbalance
    - Exploitation
  meaning: >
    Reversed, the generosity comes with conditions. Gifts used as leverage,
    charity that humiliates, debts that create dependency. Or the opposite —
    refusing to receive because it feels like surrender. The scale tips
    and the exchange becomes exploitation.
imagery:
  - element: Merchant holding a balanced scale
    significance: >
      The scale is the card's moral center — justice, fairness, measured
      giving. But scales also weigh and judge. The merchant decides who gets
      what and how much. Generosity and power are inseparable here. He is
      simultaneously charitable and in control.
    tradition: Justice symbolism / mercantile tradition
  - element: Two kneeling figures receiving coins
    significance: >
      They kneel — gratitude or supplication? The posture is ambiguous by
      design. Receiving help changes your relationship to the giver. The
      card doesn't let you ignore this: even benevolent giving creates
      hierarchy.
    tradition: Christian charity traditions / social symbolism
  - element: Six pentacles arranged above the scene
    significance: >
      The coins float above all three figures, suggesting that wealth itself
      is neither the merchant's nor the beggars' — it circulates. The six
      pentacles belong to the system, not to any individual.
    tradition: Numerological / economic symbolism
  - element: Rich robes of the merchant versus rags of the kneeling figures
    significance: >
      The visual contrast makes the power dynamic impossible to ignore.
      Wealth isn't just numbers — it's expressed through clothing, posture,
      who stands and who kneels. Material inequality is embodied.
    tradition: Social realism / class symbolism

  tree_of_life: "Tiphareth (Beauty) — harmony and balance in Earth"
  numerology: >
    6 — harmony, reciprocity, balance. The number of equilibrium after
    the disruption of five. In Pentacles, six restores material order
    through the act of sharing — but balanced sharing requires awareness
    of power.
  colors:
    - Purple (wealth, authority, the merchant's status)
    - Gold (the coins, the pentacles — wealth in circulation)
    - Brown and grey (the kneeling figures — poverty, earth)
connections:
  - card: pentacles-04
    relationship: polarity
    description: >
      The Four hoards; the Six distributes. They represent the two extremes
      of material relationship — clutching and giving. The healthy middle
      ground lies somewhere between them.
  - card: pentacles-05
    relationship: sequence
    description: >
      The Five's suffering finds relief in the Six's generosity. These cards
      often appear in sequence in a reading, suggesting that hardship is
      followed by help — but help that comes with its own complexities.

    relationship: echo
    description: >
      Justice also holds a scale and makes measured decisions about
      fairness. The Six of Pentacles is Justice applied to material
      resources — who deserves what, and who decides.
themes:
  - "The politics of generosity — giving as both kindness and power"
  - "Circulation versus accumulation — wealth as flow"
  - "The dignity question — how to give and receive without losing yourself"
questions:
  - "When you give, is it from genuine generosity or a need to feel powerful?"
  - "When you receive help, what does it cost your sense of self?"
  - "Who holds the scale in your most important relationships?"
  - "What would truly equal exchange look like in your life?"

    author: "Arthur Edward Waite"
    relevance: "Waite describes this as a card of 'presents, gifts, gratification' — but the image he commissioned is far more ambiguous than his keywords suggest."

    relevance: "Pollack's reading is particularly sharp on the power dynamics — she asks whose perspective the querent occupies: giver or receiver."
