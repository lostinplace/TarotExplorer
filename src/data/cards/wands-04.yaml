    - Celebration
    - Harmony
    - Homecoming
    - Community
    - Milestone
  meaning: >
    Four wands form a decorated canopy draped with garlands as figures celebrate
    below. This is a moment of arrival — a milestone reached, a home established,
    a community gathered in joy. Not the end of the journey, but a pause to
    honor what's been built so far.

  keywords:
    - Instability at home
    - Disrupted celebration
    - Feeling unwelcome
    - Transition
    - Lack of roots
  meaning: >
    The celebration is hollow or strained. Domestic tension, feeling like an
    outsider in your own community, or a milestone that doesn't feel earned.
    Can indicate upheaval in the home — renovations, moves, or relationships
    that have lost their sense of welcome.
imagery:
  - element: Four wands with a garland canopy
    significance: >
      The chuppah or wedding canopy — a sacred space defined by four pillars.
      The garlands of flowers and fruit suggest abundance and fertility. The
      structure is temporary and open, not a fortress — this is celebration,
      not defense.
    tradition: Jewish wedding tradition / festival architecture
  - element: Two dancing figures with bouquets
    significance: >
      Joy expressed through the body — not contemplation but active celebration.
      The raised bouquets echo the garlands above, suggesting that the people
      and the structure mirror each other. Community in harmony.
    tradition: RWS — figures as emotional expression
  - element: Castle or estate in the background
    significance: >
      A substantial structure behind the celebration — home, security, the
      established foundation that makes celebration possible. You celebrate
      because you've built something worth celebrating.
    tradition: RWS scenic convention — buildings as achievement
  - element: Bridge leading to the castle
    significance: >
      A path connecting the celebration to the home — suggesting this joy
      is connected to a real place, a real belonging. The bridge implies
      transition and welcome.
    tradition: RWS scenic detail

  numerology: >
    4 — stability, structure, foundation. The first solid form. In Wands,
    Fire's restless energy finds a container — not a cage, but a hearth.
    Celebration requires a stable place to gather.
  colors:
    - Yellow (joy, warmth, celebration)
    - Green (garlands, growth, fertility)

    description: >
      The Three sent ships to the horizon; the Four celebrates their arrival.
      Expansion yields a homecoming — the fruits of foresight made tangible.
  - card: cups-10
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      Both cards depict communal joy and domestic harmony. The Four of Wands
      is the milestone; the Ten of Cups is the fulfillment. Same warmth,
      different scale.
  - card: pentacles-04
    relationship: polarity
    description: >
      The Four of Pentacles hoards and protects; the Four of Wands shares
      and celebrates. Both are about what you do with stability — cling to
      it or dance on it.
themes:
  - "Celebration as sacred act — pausing to honor what you've built"
  - "Home as something created, not just found"
  - "Community joy — success that's shared rather than solitary"
questions:
  - "What milestone have you reached that deserves celebration?"
  - "Where do you feel most at home — and what makes it feel that way?"
  - "When did you last pause to enjoy what you've accomplished before pushing forward?"
