  meaning: >
    Two ragged figures trudge through snow past a lit stained-glass window
    depicting five pentacles. They are cold, injured, destitute — and they
    walk right past the warmth without looking up. This is material hardship
    compounded by spiritual blindness: the help exists, but suffering has
    narrowed their vision to the ground beneath their feet.

    - Spiritual wealth
    - Turning point
  meaning: >
    Reversed, the figures finally look up and see the lit window — or the
    door beside it. Recovery begins, help is accepted, or you discover that
    material loss has paradoxically freed you to find something more
    valuable. The worst is behind you.
imagery:
  - element: Two figures in rags walking through snow
    significance: >
      The pair suggests shared suffering — poverty is rarely solitary. One
      figure is bandaged and on crutches; the other is barefoot. They have
      each other but seem too absorbed in misery to draw comfort from
      companionship. Suffering can isolate even when you're not alone.
    tradition: Christian iconography of the poor and afflicted
  - element: Stained-glass window with five pentacles
    significance: >
      The window is lit from within — warmth, sanctuary, spiritual wealth
      are available. The five pentacles in the glass suggest that material
      abundance exists in a spiritual dimension even when absent in the
      physical. The church represents community, charity, refuge. They
      don't look up.
    tradition: Christian / ecclesiastical symbolism
  - element: Snow covering the ground
    significance: >
      Winter — the season of scarcity, dormancy, endurance. The Earth
      element at its coldest and most barren. But snow also melts; winter
      always ends. The hardship is real but not permanent.
    tradition: Seasonal / elemental symbolism
  - element: Bell visible above the church window
    significance: >
      The bell calls the faithful, announces sanctuary. It's another signal
      the figures might hear if they weren't so focused on their suffering.
      Help isn't just available — it's actively calling to them.
    tradition: Christian liturgical tradition

  numerology: >
    5 — disruption, conflict, instability. The number that breaks the
    stability of four. In Pentacles, five is material crisis — the moment
    when the structure fails and you must find a new foundation.
  colors:
    - White (snow, cold, barrenness)
    - Black (the figures' ragged clothes, despair)
    - Gold and warm light (the window — hope they haven't seen)

    description: >
      The Five is deprivation; the Six is generosity. The merchant in the
      Six may be giving to figures like those in the Five. Recovery from
      the Five often looks like the Six — receiving help from someone with
      more.

    relationship: echo
    description: >
      The Tower and the Five of Pentacles both depict figures cast out of
      a structure. The Tower is sudden; the Five is grinding. Both ask
      what remains when material security is stripped away.
  - card: cups-05
    relationship: echo
    description: >
      Both Fives depict loss and grief. The Five of Cups mourns emotional
      loss but has cups still standing; the Five of Pentacles suffers
      material loss but has a lit window nearby. Both miss what remains.
themes:
  - "The blindness of suffering — how hardship narrows perception"
  - "Help unasked for — pride, shame, and the refusal to receive"
  - "Material versus spiritual poverty — which is the real deprivation?"
  - "The dark night of the soul — necessary passage, not permanent state"
questions:
  - "What help is available to you right now that you're not seeing or accepting?"
  - "Is your current hardship material, spiritual, or both?"
  - "Who have you walked past while focused on your own pain?"
  - "What would it cost you to ask for help — and what does it cost you not to?"
